// HOW TO RUN : open terminal -> node 07_ASSIGNMENT.js
// RULES -> prompt() works ONLY in the browser console -> we run files with node, so every

//          and verify ALL the cases written in the question.
//          for every task FIRST write your plan as a comment, THEN write the code and test it.

// 3. BONUS -> INTERVIEW CHECK ( answer in comments ) :
//    a) why does  case "monday" || "mon":  never work as expected ? what does || really return ?
//       what is the correct way to give the SAME output to several case values ?
//    b) when should you choose a switch over the else if ladder ? give one use case for each.
//    c) what happens when you FORGET the break inside a switch ? what is this behaviour called ?
//       write a small example in comments.
//    d) what does the  switch ( true ) { case condition: ... }  pattern do ?
//       when do you NEED it ( what can a normal case value NOT do ) ?

console.log("<-------------------- Level 3 - Q2 ------------------------------------>")

// Answer:
// a) case "monday" || "mon": never works as expected because || returns the first truthy value.
//    "monday" is already truthy, so "monday" || "mon" becomes only "monday".
//    Therefore, "mon" will never match
//    To give the same output to several case values, use stacked cases (fall-through)
//
//    case "monday":
//    case "mon":
//        console.log("work from office")
//        break


// b) Choose switch when one parameter needs to be compared with many fixed values
//    Example: checking a day name -> "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", etc.
//
//    Choose else if when you need ranges or complex conditions
//    Example: checking marks -> marks >= 80, marks >= 70, etc.


// c) If we forget the break inside a switch, the code continues executing the next cases
//    even after a case has matched
//    This behaviour is called fall through
//
//    Example:
//    let num = 2
//
//    switch (num) {
//        case 2:
//            console.log("two")
//        case 3:
//            console.log("three")
//    }
//
//    Output:
//    two
//    three


// d) switch (true) allows us to use conditions or ranges as cases
//    Each case is evaluated as true or false, and the first true case matches
//
//    A normal switch case compares one parameter with fixed values
//    It cannot directly use a condition like case marks > 80: for range checking
//
//    switch (true) is useful when we want to check conditions or ranges inside a switch
//
//    Example:
//    let marks = 85
//
//    switch (true) {
//        case marks >= 80:
//            console.log("A grade")
//            break
//        case marks >= 70:
//            console.log("B grade")
//            break
